In a previous post, I discussed how genetic data can provide evidence of recent selection. The broad takeaway was that locus-specific selection in the past 5,000 years appears to be extremely rare and idiosyncratic.

Here I want to keep moving backwards from 5,000 years to 50,000 years and discuss some recent studies that might change our understanding evolution during this time. To do that, let's first look at the potential confounders of selection and then what the data show.

## Why is it hard to detect a selective sweep?

At its core, a test for locus-specific selection seeks to identify genetic patterns that deviate from what would be expected under neutrality. This task is made difficult by competing neutral processes that introduce deviations of their own.

### Genetic drift

When data is available from multiple time points, one could imagine a basic test for selection that simply quantifies whether allele frequencies have changed at all. In real populations, however, allele frequencies can also change due to neutral genetic drift: the random walk that alleles take over the course of successive generations. To illustrate this, the figure below shows results under neutrality (black) and positive selection (blue) for populations with (right) and without (left) drift. In a world without drift, allele frequencies stay exactly the same over time. In our world, drift variance leads some neutral allele frequencies to shift significantly and some selected alleles to stay the same.

To make things more complicated, the magnitude of drift depends on the demographic history of the population: the smaller the effective population size, the more alleles can change frequencies over generations (i.e. the larger the steps in the random walk), and the larger the drift variance.

Importantly, this limitation cannot be overcome solely by increasing the sample size. Since we only get to observe the allele frequency once in a population, additional samples do not provide additional power beyond the accuracy of the frequency estimate itself (which can typically be obtained with tens/hundreds of samples). For example, in a population with Ne=1,000 there are many alleles under selection that have frequency differences lower than those of neutrally drifting alleles, including some selected variants that have not changed frequency at all (because drift counter-acted the selective pressure). Such variants fundamentally cannot be identified as being under selection from frequency alone. This is in contrast to association studies (GWAS), which can identify increasingly weaker and weaker effects on a trait as the sample size increases because estimation error is the dominant source of noise.

### Gene flow

While drift adds random variation to the genetic data, gene flow introduces systematic changes due to the influx of new genetic material from a previously separated population. The figure below, from an analysis of ~1,600 ancient genomes by Irving-Pease et al. (2024), shows a tree-based reconstruction of the primary flows of genetic ancestry, starting from the Out of Africa migrations at the top and leading to modern-day Europeans at the bottom.

The key events here are: the out of Africa expansion and split into "basal" Northern European (NE) and Western Asian (WA) populations ~55kya; further population splits into the core ancestral populations of hunter-gatherers (EHG/WHG/CHG) and Anatolian farmers (ANA) 20-30kya; and subsequent population admixtures 5-9kya leading to the present-day Europeans. This graph is obviously a simplification of the true demography, but ancient DNA data clearly supports multiple large scale separations and mixtures in recent history. Each branch of the tree is also labeled with its effective population size, and you may notice that some branches exhibit much smaller populations than others. Drift and gene flow can thus compound: smaller isolated populations accumulating more genetic variation over the same time period and then propagating that variation through gene flow.

### Background selection

In addition to these neutral confounders, a third non-neutral process indirectly shapes neutral variation: negative "background selection". Background selection is the steady purging of deleterious alleles together with any neutral variation that resides on the same haplotype background.

Neutral alleles that, through bad luck, happen to be on a low fitness background, will be gradually pulled down in frequency even though they have no direct fitness consequence. The strength of background selection will vary across the genome, depending on the local recombination rate (the lower the recombination rate, the more distant deleterious alleles can have an influence on a given neutral site) and the rate/strength of nearby deleterious mutations. Background selection has two practical consequences. Over the long term, it can be thought of as a region-specific reduction in the effective population size or an increase in drift, because fewer haplotypes are "surviving" in the population. Over the short term, it also induces a covariance in the frequency of the neutral allele across generations [Buffalo et al. (2019)].

Under background selection, an allele that decreased in frequency from generation 0-1 is also more likely to decrease in frequency from generations 2-3 as long as there is still deleterious variation on the background. This is not the case for drift, which is a random walk from generation to generation. Thus, alleles in regions under background selection will have more frequency changes over time and more covariance in those changes across serial measurements. When seeking to identify loci under selection, all of these processes need to be incorporated into the null model to avoid being fooled by the randomness of neutrality.

### An alternative perspective: the coalescent

So far we have primarily discussed individual alleles, but it is also useful to think about how selection reshapes broader genetic relationships. For a pair of contemporary (or ancient) individuals, we can walk along the genome and estimate the time until they coalesce at their Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA). When an allele is under selection, it spreads more rapidly through the population, and carriers of the allele will have more recent coalescences than expected from drift alone.

Under neutrality, an allele will drift through the population and may gradually reach fixation based on pure luck. Whereas under positive selection, a strongly selected allele sweeps quickly through the population resulting in denser and more recent coalescent times in expectation. Thus, local distortions in the coalescent distribution can be used as indicators of selection. Background selection also influences the coalescent, because the branches with deleterious mutations propagate more slowly than those without. Regions under background selection will thus exhibit denser, more recent coalescences even though no positive selection is occurring. There's no free lunch: coalescent-based models also need to distinguish selection from neutral drift, gene flow, and background selection by accurately estimating the global and local demography. And just as with allelic tests, the power of coalescent-based models no longer increases with sample size once the structure of the demography is accurately estimated in the time period of interest.

## Selection in the past 20,000 years

As discussed in the prior post, Field et al. (2016) used insights from the coalescent to derive an elegant test for very recent selection (2,000 years) based on the density of rare variants (the Singleton Density Score or SDS). With additional modeling, the same intuition can be applied to identify less recent selection by estimating and evaluating deeper coalescences. Now let's take a look at some of the largest studies using different data to detect selection in the past 20,000 years.

### From modern data

Palamara et al. (2018) inferred coalescent relationships in >100,000 modern British samples and looked for loci with unusually low recent coalescent times as evidence of recent positive selection. This statistic was estimated to have high power for selection specifically in the past 20,000 years. To estimate the null coalescent expectation due to drift and gene flow, the authors fit a distribution for their test statistic from putatively neutral regions of the genome. Which regions of the genome are actually neutral is unknown, but this heuristic is widely used in the literature. In total, the approach identified **12 genome-wide significant signals** (across ~63,000 regions tested). Six of the loci were previously known and mapped to well-established genes for lactase (LCT), autoimmunity (HLA, TLR, IGH) and skin/eye pigment (GRM5, MC1R). The six novel loci did not contain obvious smoking gun genes, though they were generally involved in immune response. Thus, even with a massive data set we see relatively few traces of selection in the past 20,000 years. And what about confounding from background selection? This test does not explicitly model it beyond focusing on coalescences in the relatively recent time period. So even some of these loci may, in truth, reflect background processes.

### From ancient data

Irving-Pease et al. (2024) also used a coalescent-based approach to look for unusual outliers, but additionally allowed for the inclusion of observations from ancient DNA samples. Rather than calibrate against putatively neutral loci, they derive an approximate likelihood for the observed allele trajectory versus a neutral one (see: CLUES and CLUES2). This likelihood ratio provides a formal test for selection, but depends on the (possibly strong) assumption that the population demography was inferred accurately by the model and that selection was constant and homogenous. When applied to modern genomic sequencing data from Europeans to look for selection in the past 15,000 years, **zero significant loci** were identified. The top ranked SNP, however, was in the well-established lactase/LCT locus, consistent with prior studies. When applied to ~1,000 ancient European genomes, **11 significant loci** were identified among variants that were previously identified in GWAS. Finally, when further stratifying the ancient data on local ancestry due to admixture, **21 significant loci** were identified. Taken together, these findings suggest that ancient admixture/gene flow is pervasive and can act to dilute the historic influence of selection (more on this later). Still, even after accounting for admixture, the number of detectable loci was quite small, as had been observed from modern data and more recent time scales.

Le et al. (2022) likewise used data from ~1,300 ancient genomes to investigate selection with an allelic test. Specifically (following the approach of Mathieson et al. discussed in the previous post) each variant was modeled as a mixture of allele frequencies in ancestral mixing populations, and then tested for deviation from this expectation in a given time period. This directly accounts for gene flow, but what about drift and background selection? To account for this residual confounding, the authors exclude putatively functional regions and estimate a "genomic inflation" parameter based on how strongly the full distribution of test statistics deviates from the null. The reasoning is that most variants are presumed to be neutral, with any inflation in the median test statistic resulting from drift and other model violations; "controlling" for the inflation in the entire distribution (i.e. transforming the distribution so the median lies on the null) is then expected to isolate the true positives.

With those caveats in mind, Le et al. identified **25 loci** with genome-wide significant evidence of selection, 11 of which had been previously reported. Each locus was further assigned to the epoch where it was significant, with a roughly equal number of loci across each period. The identified loci largely relate to diet (in the Neolithic), pigment and autoimmunity (in the Bronze Age), and again diet/metabolism (in the Historical period). Surprisingly, only a single locus showed significant evidence across all time periods tested: the well-established HLA/MHC region that has emerged in nearly every prior analysis.

### From ancient data calibrated to modern data

The recent pre-print of **Akbari et al. (2024)** takes a completely different approach from prior selection scans and gets very different results. The study is exciting for several reasons: it carefully analyzes an enormous amount of new ancient DNA data from Eurasia; it uses a new model to scan for selection and a new model to establish statistical significance, neither of which require knowledge of demographic parameters; and it finds many more loci under selection than prior scans. So it is worth walking through exactly what was found and how.

Rather than attempt to model the local coalescent (as in Palamara et al. or Irving-Pease et al.) or the gene flow process (as in Le et al.), this study directly tests for an association between the frequency of each variant and the (historical) time that the corresponding sample was collected, where stronger selection is expected to produce a faster change in frequency. To account for drift and gene flow a Genetic Relatedness Matrix (GRM) is employed, which models the genetic correlations across all pairs of individuals in the study as a variance term or "random effect". This data-driven approach has been widely used in GWAS to account for population structure but is introduced here for the first time to additionally account for temporal structure and drift. The key assumption is that pairwise genetic distances between samples can capture all of the excess variance due to the numerous confounding factors. If this approach works, it could be a major advance for the field in that it does not need a demographic model of any kind to control for confounding.

Does it work? Not quite. Applied to **8,433 ancient genomes** (an absolutely massive new trove of ancient data) and 6,510 contemporary genomes from Eurasia, the statistics from the GRM-based model were still substantially inflated and did not match simulations. Using these results as-is would have identified 8,210 loci under selection, which the authors deem implausible. On the other hand, applying the conventional genomic control (as in Le et al. and Mathieson et al.) would have identified just ~48 loci. Instead, the authors chose to estimate a data-driven statistical threshold, this time by looking for consistency in modern association studies. They observe that more significant selection statistics are enriched for trait associations in contemporary GWAS data (across 107 biobank traits), and that this enrichment eventually plateaus (at a value of ~3.9x). This plateau is interpreted as the point at which the selection statistics no longer contain false-positives. Using the plateau to rescale all of the selection statistics (dividing them by a correction factor of 1.67) produced a final set of **279 independent non-HLA loci** at a 1% False Discovery Rate, an order of magnitude more than observed in prior studies and hinting at potentially thousands of loci across the genome (or as senior author David Reich put it recently: **"the whole genome is seething with these changes in this period"**).

This correction is, to some extent, a leap of faith. The model assumes that GWAS loci are truly enriched for selected alleles and false positives are otherwise random. An alternative interpretation of the co-occurrence of selection and GWAS signals is that the regions of the genome that are enriched for false positive selection signals also tend to be the regions of the genome that are enriched for GWAS associations - i.e. the two tests are confounded. In fact, we know that this is the case at least to some extent due to the action of background selection, which locally increases the rate of neutral drift (inducing false positive selection statistics) and the amount of LD (inducing more GWAS associations through tagging) and tends to occur near important genes (which also contain more GWAS associations); see Berg et al. (2019) for more on this complex relationship.

A key piece of evidence in support of the correction was that the resulting significant selection statistics were enriched for heritability of specific GWAS traits. In particular, **basic biomarker and immune-related phenotypes were significantly enriched** for heritability near loci under selection. On the other hand, **behavioral/cognitive/psychiatric traits exhibited essentially no enrichment**, with the estimates actually tracking towards depletion for loci with more significant selection statistics. You read that right, **genetic variants influencing behavioral traits do not appear to be enriched for loci that are under selection.** This is certainly an interesting finding and consistent with the variants identified in prior studies largely implicating basic immune and pigment processes. But it is hard to draw strong conclusions from the absence of enrichment, since behavioral traits also tend to have lower heritability on average and more of their own unique confounding.

How well do those 279 loci align with previous discoveries? It's complicated:

- **Mathieson et al. 2015** (12 loci): 10/12 replicate. Good.
- **Le et al.** (22 testable loci): 9/22 replicate. Mixed. Replication rates: 1/10 (Neolithic), 1/7 (Bronze Age), 5/6 (Historical).
- **Irving-Pease et al.** (21 testable loci): 13/21 had some evidence of replication.
- **Kerner et al. 2023** (123 candidate loci): just 14/123 replicate. Bad.
- **Field et al.** (SDS, 3 loci): 2/3 replicate; after relaxing threshold to 34 loci, only 1/34 replicated.

For some loci, such as a variant that has a known protective effect against HIV, the findings of the two studies were diametrically opposite. In short, prior findings are very often not replicating with this new methodology and larger dataset.

What explains the lack of replication? The authors generally hypothesize that loci identified in prior work were false positives. If they are correct it would be a finding nearly as sensational as the new loci themselves; implying that a variety of widely used prior approaches have been spitting out false selection signals at a rate of 40-60%. A more tepid conclusion is that different data and methods currently disagree on what exactly is and is not under selection, sometimes strongly.

## Selection in the past 50,000 years

### Masked sweeps and weakening selection in ancient Eurasia

Souilmi, Tobler, Johar et al. (2022) analyzed data from ~1,200 ancient genomes looking specifically for evidence of "hard sweeps" — alleles that were selected all the way to fixation. What made this study unique was the focus on simulations to assess statistical power for detecting hard sweeps at various points in time using ancient and modern data. The simulations yield three important findings for Eurasian populations:

1. Modern genomes have adequate power to detect strong selection that persists after the major admixture events (8kya).
2. Both modern and ancient data have adequate power to detect sweeps that occurred prior to the population split (55kya).
3. However, modern/admixed genomes cannot detect sweeps that begin after the population split but do not persist after admixture. These sweeps are effectively "masked" or "diluted" by admixture and only detectable in ancient data from the un-admixed source populations.

With this in mind, the real data showed evidence for **57 hard sweeps** at a liberal False Discovery Rate of 11%. These sweeps occurred after the migration out of Africa but were already observed in samples older than 30kya, implying a strong and relatively old process. Yet, strikingly, **only 2/57 were observed in modern genomes**, leading the authors to conclude that these sweeps "have been almost entirely erased from descendent populations in modern Eurasia." One explanation is that selective pressure has "eased" in the past ~10kya, with these ancient events erased by admixture and lack of persistent selection. This paints a surprisingly dynamic picture of our genetic history: variants that provide substantial fitness advantages do exist and periodically sweep up to high frequencies, only to be largely "erased" by gene flow and changing environments.

### Beyond Eurasia

Nearly all of the previously discussed studies focused on selection within Eurasia. In contrast, detecting differences in selection between populations — sometimes called recent/local adaptation — merely requires the comparison of allele frequencies between modern individuals from those populations. Coop et al. (2009) is one of the more definitive analyses comparing African and non-African groups. Using genetic data from >50 different global populations, the authors sought to identify variants that differed substantially between them by more than would be expected from neutral variation. Summarized by Pritchard, Pickrell, and Coop (2010):

> "Overall, however, the HapMap data show relatively few fixed or nearly fixed differences between populations from different continents, implying that new alleles have only rarely spread rapidly to fixation within populations, even though there has been sufficient time for strongly favored alleles (selection coefficient, s ≥ 0.5%) to spread from low to high frequency since these populations separated. Nearly all of these rare fixation events have taken place outside Africa and, curiously, most are found in the east Asians, the group that has experienced the strongest genetic drift of the three HapMap groups. For example, there are just 13 non-synonymous SNPs in Phase II HapMap with a frequency difference >90% between the Yoruba and east Asians … The observation that sweep patterns mimic neutral population structure is not what might have been expected if the frequencies of individual alleles were strongly determined by environmental factors, such as climate or diet, that likely vary over different geographic scales. Additionally, looking across all populations, and all SNPs, there is not a single example of a SNP with very extreme allele frequency differences between closely related populations. At the level of individual SNPs, there is thus no clear evidence for extreme differential adaptation between closely related populations."

In short, there were very few instances of loci under rapid adaptation between continents and none for closely related populations — consistent with a model where environmental differences are not inducing rapid selective pressures. A recent coalescent-based analysis by Speidel et al. (2019) identified 35 distinct loci with evidence of selection across 20 global populations from the 1000 Genomes cohort; i.e. fewer than two per population.

### Before Out-of-Africa

Finally, Mallick et al. (2016) investigated the hypothesis that the rapid changes in human culture and behavior over the past 50,000 years — the so-called "human revolution" — could be explained by rapid "species-wide" sweeps in the recent ancestors of modern humans. Specifically, they searched for regions of the genome with low frequency differences among modern genomes but large differences between modern and archaic genomes (Neanderthal/Denisovan, which split off from modern humans 300-800kya). They found **zero such instances**, using two different tests. Instead, they speculate that environmental shifts have been the primary driver of change in human behavior, or perhaps that there was no dramatic behavioral revolution at all.

## So … where are the selective sweeps?

Most studies agree that instances of locus-specific selection typically influence phenotypes related to **immunity, pigment, and diet** with little to no instances for cognitive/behavioral phenotypes. Even the relatively liberal analysis of Akbari et al. found that selection does not seem to be focusing, on average, on variants that influence cognitive/behavioral traits in contemporary individuals. Most of the studies also agree that there are few traces of very recent selection in modern genomes and very few unusually differentiated loci between continental populations.

Where there is dispute is how to interpret the evidence from ancient genomes in Eurasia:
- **Irving-Pease et al. and Souilmi et al.** argue that there may be a few strong selective sweeps during the post-split / pre-admixture period but they have been "masked" by subsequent admixture events in conjunction with weakening selection.
- **Akbari et al.** argue that there is evidence for hundreds or even thousands of loci under selection in ancient data and propose two explanatory hypotheses: (1) that selection has fluctuated substantially over time and prevented alleles from reaching fixation between continental populations; or (2) that selection has been somehow qualitatively different (focusing on immune traits) and accelerating in the past 10,000 years, driven by major environmental and cultural changes.

These hypotheses are difficult to test and do not yet fit together into one unified theory. If selection was accelerating, one would expect to see more loci under recent selection in modern data, for which we have very powerful tests and fewer technical challenges — yet modern genomes show hardly any loci under recent selection (Palamara et al.). If selection was fluctuating, one would expect it to be missed by the (essentially) linear model that was employed by Akbari et al. — yet the linear model implicates thousands of loci. Assuming fluctuations in selection are a frequent evolutionary response to environmental changes, one would also expect to see many loci deviating from the neutral drift between nearby populations — yet this is never observed in modern global data (Coop et al.) nor in comparison to archaic humans (Mallick et al.). Finally, various widely used methodologies still largely disagree on the individual selected loci they do identify.

Will better models show that much of what we think is selection is actually confounding from complex gene flow, background selection, and drift? Or will they reveal an even larger number of loci under fluctuating selection? More data from other epochs, more ancient data from other populations, and — most importantly — more sophisticated modeling is needed to resolve these contradictions.

## Footnotes

1. The coalescences across all observed individuals and loci can be stored in a compact data structure called the Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG). See Nielsen et al. (2024) for more.

2. A key innovation of Palamara et al. was the ability to estimate coalescence times from data with just common genotype variation rather than whole-genome sequencing, enabling analysis of many more individuals.

3. Interestingly, even the classic LCT locus appears to exhibit some idiosyncratic timing, as recently highlighted by Vaughn et al. (2024): "For the MCM6 locus [regulating LCT], we find a significant increase in the lactase persistence allele beginning ∼6,000 years before the present. We note that this is thousands of years after the consumption of dairy began in Europe … This gap, which has previously been noted in several studies, suggests that the selective pressure for lactase persistence was not in fact the initial domestication of animals and ensuing increase in lactose consumption."

4. "We turned to simulation, which suggests that the control factor for the nominal χ2 is 1.04. The nominal genome-wide significance threshold, corresponding to an adjusted P-value threshold of 5e-8 with CF=1.04, is p=2.7e-8, which yields 8,210 independent loci. The FDR for this threshold is estimated to be 44%, which is far more than the <1% that would be expected if the threshold was well-calibrated." ~ Akbari et al.

5. "To adjust for residual confounding of our selection statistics, we tried adjusting with genomic inflation (λGC) … This empirical correction factor is 5.26 for our dataset … which yields 48 independent loci, excluding the HLA region." ~ Akbari et al.

6. "We tried multiple approaches to control family wise error rate (FWER). However, we found that these approaches are either inefficient or not robust. We used an alternative approach of controlling for false discovery rate (FDR) by leveraging high quality GWAS studies." ~ Akbari et al.

7. "We find that the proportion of SNPs showing significant association to a phenotype in a GWAS increases dramatically with our selection statistic Z, plateauing at around 3.9-times the rate of overlap for random SNPs." ~ Akbari et al.

8. "We confirmed that our X-statistics are detecting biologically meaningful patterns by showing that signals of selection are unusually associated with specific classes of traits. In particular, we find enrichment for SNPs contributing to blood-immune-inflammatory traits (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-6.8) … In contrast, for mental-psychiatric-nervous and behavioral traits, we do not see enrichment (95% CI of 0.2-1.3 and 0.5-1.4)." ~ Akbari et al.

9. On the HIV-protective variant: "We find that the allele was probably positively selected ∼6000 to ∼2000 years ago, increasing from ∼2% to ∼8%" ~ Akbari et al. vs. "Across the 3 epochs, we find no evidence for selection of this allele (p=0.55, 0.05, 0.34 for the EN, BA, and H epochs respectively)" ~ Le et al.

13. "An intriguing implication arising from the simulations is that the selection pressure(s) underlying the sweeps may have eased during the Holocene period in some cases." ~ Souilmi et al.

14. "Thus, our results provide evidence against a model in which one or a few mutations were responsible for the rapid developments in human behaviour in the last 50,000 years. Instead, changes in lifestyles due to cultural innovation or exposure to new environments are likely to have been driving forces." ~ Mallick et al.

15. Here's how senior author David Reich summarized it on a recent podcast: "If you look at traits that we know today affect immune disease or metabolic disease, these traits are highly overrepresented by a factor of maybe four in the collection of variants that are changing rapidly over time. Whereas if you look at traits that are affecting cognition that we know in modern people modulate behavior, they're hardly affected at all. Selection in the last 10,000 years doesn't seem to be focusing, on average, on cognitive and behavioral traits. It seems to be focusing on immune and cardiometabolic traits, on average, with exceptions."

16. "The simplest way to resolve this paradox is to recognize that selection coefficients are unlikely to have been constant over time, even though we make this simplifying assumption to make it possible to detect selection … we find that around half of the mutations have true ages an order of magnitude larger than the expected sweep age, which means that selection coefficients on the alleles must have shifted over time." ~ Akbari et al.

17. "An alternative explanation for this paradox is to hypothesize that West Eurasians have been experiencing qualitatively more and different natural selection in the Holocene than in earlier periods because of rapidly changing lifestyles and economies … this hypothesis is consistent with our evidence of particular intense selection for blood-immune-inflammatory traits, and our evidence that selection for these traits becoming even stronger in the Bronze Age than it was in earlier periods." ~ Akbari et al.
