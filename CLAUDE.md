# Reich Interview Prep — Claude Notes

## Context
Prepping for a podcast interview with David Reich (Harvard geneticist, ancient DNA pioneer). Core topic: natural selection in recent human evolution — why so few selective sweeps have been detected, the role of gene flow vs. selection, and what ancient DNA can tell us.

## Important Instruction
**You are encouraged and expected to proactively web search and look things up** — not just when explicitly asked. If a question comes up during prep that could benefit from checking a paper, a recent development, or a definition, do it. Use WebSearch and WebFetch freely throughout sessions.

## Key Themes / Tensions to Explore in Interview
- Why are so few loci under detectable recent selection, given massive environmental change in last 10k years?
- Gene flow vs. selection: which explains allele frequency change more?
- The Akbari et al. 279-loci result vs. more conservative estimates — what should we believe?
- Cognitive traits specifically: "not enriched for selection" — is this a methodological limit or real?
- What does selection on immune/diet traits tell us about human history?
- Effective population size ~10,000: what are the implications?
