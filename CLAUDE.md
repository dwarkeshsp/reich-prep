# Reich Interview Prep — Claude Notes

## Context
Prepping for a podcast interview with David Reich (Harvard geneticist, ancient DNA pioneer). Core topic: natural selection in recent human evolution — why so few selective sweeps have been detected, the role of gene flow vs. selection, and what ancient DNA can tell us.

## Important Instruction
**You are encouraged and expected to proactively web search and look things up** — not just when explicitly asked. If a question comes up during prep that could benefit from checking a paper, a recent development, or a definition, do it. Use WebSearch and WebFetch freely throughout sessions.

## Key Themes / Tensions to Explore in Interview
- Why are so few loci under detectable recent selection, given massive environmental change in last 10k years?
- Gene flow vs. selection: which explains allele frequency change more?
- The Akbari et al. 279-loci result vs. more conservative estimates — what should we believe?
- Cognitive traits specifically: "not enriched for selection" — is this a methodological limit or real?
- What does selection on immune/diet traits tell us about human history?
- Effective population size ~10,000: what are the implications?

### From Gusev Prep Call (Feb 21, 2026)
- **Lactase timing puzzle:** Selection on LCT is temporally out of sync with archaeological evidence of domestication/milk use, and the selection *accelerated* for unknown reasons (Mathieson & Terhorst 2022).
- **Large-effect variants NOT under selection:** FTO (BMI), menopause variant (~5-10 year effect), lipid GWAS loci, some autoimmune variants outside HLA — none show selection. Why?
- **Slave trade paradox:** Reich's own work found no detectable selection in African Americans over ~200 years of extreme environmental pressure. If that leaves no trace, how can we see "seething selection" in Eurasia?
- **Convergent selection (Colbran et al. 2025):** Same loci under selection in Europe AND East Asia AND South Asia. Either convergent selection in different environments, or all pre-split (African) selection being misattributed to more recent periods.
- **The two explanations for no fixed differences (Coop 2009):** Either (1) selection is genuinely negligible — environmental pressures too ephemeral to matter; or (2) selection IS strong but so polygenic (100k variants each shifting by 1/100,000th) that it's invisible at individual loci.
- **Gusev is not adversarial toward Reich** — critical of Akbari methodology because it's cutting edge, but they've discussed it directly and are on good terms. Reich used Gusev's blog post as intro to a recent ASHG talk.
