Notes

Chapter 1

1. The literature on issues of phylogeny and reticulation in prehistory is rather large, but for 
differing perspectives see Bellwood 1996c, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c, 2001d; Kirch and Green 
2001; Moore 1994; Prentiss and Chatters 2003; Shennan 2002; Terrell ed. 2001.

Chapter 2

1. Chen Chi-lu 1987 discusses Taiwan; Terrell 1986:191 discusses Pitcairn; Borrie 1994 discusses Australia. See also Birdsell 1957 for Tristan da Cunha and the Bass Strait islands.

2. For instance, the need to carry children while gathering food over a very wide area, 
periodically low levels of fat intake, and longer periods of breast-feeding necessitated by 
a dearth of soft weaning foods. For discussion of these points see Blurton Jones 1986; 
Cohen 1980; Kelly 1995; Lee 1979, 1980.

3. On these health issues see, e.g., Handwerker 1983; Roosevelt 1984; Meiklejohn and 
Zvelebil 1991; Fox 1996; Jackes et al. 1997a, 1997b. For Thailand, skeletal anthropologists 
Domett 2001, and Pietrusewsky and Douglas 2001, do not find that health declined 
continuously with the development of agriculture. Pechenkina et al. 2002 state unequivocally that health decline began late rather than early in the Chinese Neolithic. 
Early Near Eastern farmers seem to have been essentially healthy without signs of 
malnutrition (e.g., Moore et al. 2000).

4. Higham and Thosarat 1994; Tayles 1999. Khok Phanom Di is not technically an earliest 
agricultural site - it dates to only 2000 Bc (as opposed to rice-growing cultures at 7000 BC 
in the Yangzi Basin) and probably represents a movement of rice agriculturalists from a 
homeland region further north into a swampy coastal environment where malaria rapidly 
became endemic. Malaria is known to cause spontaneous abortion, hence its devastating 
effect on infant mortality here. Although the possession of abnormal haemoglobin alleles can give some protection for heterozygotes, homozygotes will succumb either to malaria 
or to anemia.

5. Bender 1978; Hayden 1990, 1992, 1995; Runnels and van Andel 1988; Dickson 1989. See 
also Chang 1981, 1986; Thorpe 1996 and Price and Gebauer 1995 for recent statements 
in favor of affluence models, in which agriculture commenced as a supplement to other 
food sources in relatively rich environments. Farrington and Urry (1985) favour an initial 
domestication of "culturally valued foodstuffs" rather than staples.

6. For example, Kennedy 1969 for northern New Zealand; Graham 1994 for northern Mexico.

7. Levant - Lieberman 1998; Moore et al. 2000; Turkey - Rosenberg' et al. 1998; Sudan - 
Haaland 1997; Mexico - Niederberger 1979.

8. Pennington 1996; Gomes 1990; Kelly 1995; Rosenberg 1998.

9. While checking proofs I discovered Bruce Smith's (2003) suggestion that "low-level food 
production" of between 30 and 50 percent of total dietary intake, combined with continuing foraging, was a stable adaptation for many societies in prehistory. This is contrary to what is being suggested in this chapter, even though Smith's two main prehistoric 
examples - eastern USA pre-maize agriculture and the Jomon of Japan - appear to be 
well chosen. But the ethnographic examples of low-level food production that he identifies, namely the Austronesian-speaking Nuaulu of equatorial Seram Island in eastern 
Indonesia, and the Numic (Uto-Aztecan) speaking Paiute and Shoshone populations 
of the Owens Valley of eastern California and the Great Basin, all in my view descend 
from ancestral agricultural societies (see pp. 243-4 for the Numic speakers). In other 
words, the ancestors of these modern groups adopted a partial or entirely hunting and 
gathering lifestyle after moving into environments inimical to successful agriculture, as 
described in more detail later in this chapter. So, while low-level food production can 
exist in theory, my feeling is that it has always been a child of marginal environments, 
where farmers necessarily retracted into food collection or where foragers were able to 
invest in minor cultivation without too much competition from other farmers. Such 
societies represent the ends, rather than the sources, of historical trajectories of agricultural expansion.

10. Gellner 1988; Eder 1987; A.B. Smith 1990, 1998; Ingold 1991; Bird-David 1990, 1992.

11. Examples include Mbuti-Bantu interaction in central Africa (Bahuchet et al. 1991); Semangfarmer exchange in Malaysia (Dunn 1975; Endicott and Bellwood 1991; Gregg 1979-80; 
Endicott 1997); and Agta-Filipino exchange in the Philippines (Headland and Reid 1989; 
Peterson 1978; Headland 1986).

12. Wilmsen and Denbow (1990) favor a continuous moving in and out of pastoralism for 
the San since about AD 600, as does Schrire (1980). The neighboring linguistically and 
biologically related Khoikhoi (or Khoekhoe) adopted pastoralism as much as 1,500-2,000 
years ago (Barnard 1992; A.B. Smith 1993). But other scholars regard many of the San, 
especially the remoter groups, as always having been "genuine" hunter-gatherers (Solway 
and Lee 1990, Lee and Guenther 1990; Yellen 1990; also Lee 1979 on !Kung history). 
Archaeology gives strong support to the view that San and Khoi have been relatively 
separate since 1500 BP, and that the San have an independent hunter-gatherer prehistory 
(Smith 1993). See also Bird-David 1992; Kent 1992; Jolly 1996; Sadr 1997.

13. Peterson 1976; Chase 1989. Jones and Meehan (1989), and Yen (1995), also note that 
Arnhem Land Aboriginal groups exploited many wild plants which were cultivated elsewhere outside Australia - yams, taro, pandanus, and rice. No attempts to domesticate 
these plants in Australia have ever been recorded. Aboriginal populations at European contact showed no signs whatever of being in transition to agriculture, despite occasional contacts with Papuan gardeners in the Torres Strait Islands.

14. Binford (1980) presented a classification of hunter-gatherer societies, which clearly 
resembles that of Woodburn, in which he distinguished forager and collector variants. 
Foragers are very mobile and move frequently from one resource zone to another in 
relatively non-seasonal environments. Collectors inhabit more seasonal environments 
which induce them to store food and generally to be more sedentary in their settlement 
patterns. Collectors come closer to the delayed return societies of Woodburn. Binford 
relates his two variants to environmental (non-seasonal versus seasonal) factors rather 
than to social factors such as presence or absence of circumscription. In reality, it seems 
likely that both pairs of factors have a role to play in inducing cultural variation. See 
Keeley 1988 for a similar division of hunter-gatherers into simple and complex types.

15. Schwartz 1963. See also Sather 1995 for the view that such specializations of economy 
within a single ethnic group, from hunter-gatherer to farmer, characterized Austronesian 
societies in general from very early times (e.g., from the Proto-Malayo-Polynesian linguistic phase, ca. 2500 Bc).

16. See Headland 1993; Berreman 1999; and also Bellwood 1997a; Blust 1989; Hoffman 1986; 
Sandbukt 1991 and Headland 1993 for general discussion of these issues. Brosius 1991 
and Sellato 1994 are against this view of an agricultural origin for the Punan of 
Borneo - Sellato (1994:7) terms them "an autonomous original culture of nomadic 
hunter-gatherers."

17. References for these cases: Nurse et al. 1985 (Africa); Guddemi 1992 (Sepik); Gardner 
1993; Zide and Zide 1976 (India). For debate on the Okiek see Blackburn 1982; Chang 
1982; Newman 1995:173-174.

18. Lathrap 1969; Stearmann 1991; Kent 1992. The issue of whether the Amazonian hunters 
and gatherers descend from cultivating or hunting founder societies is interesting but 
rather insoluble (Rival 1999; Roosevelt 1999a). A continuous hunter-gatherer ancestry 
seems likely for many Je speaking groups in Southeast Amazonia, but perhaps not for 
other groups who speak languages also spoken by farming populations. This is an area 
of much uncertainty.

19. See Zvelebil and Rowley-Convey 1986; Rowley-Conwy 2001; Gregg 1988 for such possibilities in Neolithic Europe.

20. Ancient peoples often maintained contacts over quite large distances, so in some ways it 
is counter-productive to argue over whether or not these regions witnessed absolutely 
pristine developments towards agriculture in isolation. The most significant observation 
for each of them is that they present very strong hints that agriculture was essentially an 
internal development.

Chapter 3

1. Childe 1936; Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1992; Bellwood 1989, 1996b; Sherratt 1997b.

2. On these environmental changes see Byrne 1987; Bottema 1995; Butzer 1995; Bar-Yosef 
1996; Hillman 1996; Sanlaville 1996; Simmons 1997; Hillman et al. 2001; van Andel 2000; 
Chappell 2001; Cappers and Bottema 2002.

3. General accounts may be found in Heiser 1990; Evans 1993; Smith 1995; Harlan 1995; 
Willcox 1999; Zohary and Hopf 2000.

4. In hulled wheats and barley (all wild cereals are hulled) the grains are enclosed by tough 
cases termed glumes, which protect them from predators and the elements during 
dormancy. In many domesticated cereals (e.g., bread wheat) the grains are only held 
loosely within much-reduced glumes. These are much easier to thresh and are sometimes referred to as naked-grained cereals. Hulled cereals continued to be grown throughout prehistory in many regions because they were more disease- and drought-resistant 
than the naked varieties. For the distributions of wild and domesticated cereals and 
legumes in archaeological sites in the Levant, see Garrard (1999) and Colledge (2001).

5. For example, wild barley occurs in Natufian contexts at Wadi Hammeh 27 (Edwards 1991) 
and Hayonim Cave (Capdevila 1992); in PPNA contexts at Netiv Hagdud and Gilgal, 
both in the Jordan Valley (Bar-Yosef 1991; Kislev 1997); and also in PPNA contexts at Jerf 
el Ahmar and Dja'de on the Middle Euphrates in northern Syria (Willcox 1996).

6. Sites of the earliest agricultural phases in Southwest Asia and the Yellow River Valley of 
northern China normally produce large numbers of stone mortars and grinders. As 
Wright (1994) points out, these would also have been needed in Southwest Asia to grind 
flour, assuming that ancient people ate their cereals, as they do now, in various baked 
bread or cake preparations (Molleson 1994).

7. Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 1998. For overall reviews of the Natufian see Bar-Yosef 
and Belfer-Cohen 1989a; Gilead 1991; Byrd 1989; Henry 1989; Belfer-Cohen 1991; 
Bar-Yosef and Valla eds. 1991; Olszewski 1991; Anderson ed. 1992; Bar-Yosef 1998b; 
Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef 2000; Bar-Yosef 2003.

Bar-Yosef 1996, 1998a, 1998b, 2002; Harris 2002.

9. On commensals, compare Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef 2000; Edwards 1989; Lieberman 
1991, 1993, 1998. On social differentiation see Olszewski 1991; Byrd and Monahan 1995; 
Kuijt 2oo0b.

10. Although as Ofer Bar-Yosef (pers. comm.) has pointed out to me, there is no proof that 
the early pottery was used for cooking.

11. Some botanists favor at least a small presence of domesticated cereals in the PPNA, for 
instance at Jericho (Hopf 1983) and Tell Aswad near Damascus (Miller 1992), but dates 
for these sites are uncertain (see Stordeur 2003 for doubts over the presence of the PPNA 
at Tell Aswad). Kislev (1992, 1997) believes that domesticated cereal remains do not 
occur until the PPNB, after 8500 BC (see also Willcox 1996 for the northern Levant), and 
also points out that the occasional cereal fragments with domesticated morphology 
from PPNA sites could just represent rare non-shattering individuals in wild populations. 
The precise chronology for the appearance of morphologically domesticated cereals thus 
remains a little obscure. For further discussion see Harris 1998a; Garrard 1999; Edwards 
and Higham 2001; papers in Cappers and Bottema 2002; and Colledge et al. 2004.

12. In favor of a southern Levant origin see McCorriston and Hole 1991; Bar-Yosef 1994:53; 
Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995. For a central Levant origin see Bar-Yosef 2003. For northern 
Levant see Gopher 1994; Hillman 1996; Cauvin 2000; Lev-Yadun et at. 2000. Opinions 
change rapidly!

13. On these sites see Aurenche 1989; Betts 1994; Hillman et al. 2001; Mottram 1997; Nadel et al. 
1991; Stordeur et al. 1997; Stordeur 2000; Watkins et al. 1989; Watkins 1992; Willcox 1996.

14. Rosenberg 1994, 1999; Rosenberg and Redding 1998; Ozdogan and Balkan-Atli 1994; 
Pringle 1998; Rosenberg et al. 1998. Rowley-Conwy (2001) doubts that the pigs were 
actually domesticated at Hallan semi, as opposed to hunted intensively.

15. In addition to Hallan semi, see also Henry et al. 1999 on a possible shift from hunting 
and gathering directly into goat herding in an and region of the southern Levant. 
Domestication of goats is claimed for the Younger Dryas in the Lebanon Mountains by 
Wasse (2001), although there would appear to be no archaeological evidence directly in 
support of such an early date.

16. Note here the suggestion by Roberts 2002 that forest clearance was already under way in 
Anatolia and the Levant immediately after the end of the Younger Dryas.

17. For instance, Cauvin 1988, 1993, 2000; Aurenche 1989; Rollefson 1989; Goring-Morris 
and Belfer-Cohen 1998; Bar-Yosef 2003.

18. Perhaps the doorways were high in the walls to discourage the entry of vermin; note the 
doors about 60 centimeters above the ground in the Jordanian site of Basta, and the 
peculiar "port-holes" in the Iranian site of Ganj Dareh. At any rate, doorways are rarely 
found in the foundation structures which have survived for archaeological examination, 
and in sites such as Catalhoyuk (now shown to be of PPN foundation date - Cessford 
2001) and Baja there are suggestions for entry via roof trap-doors. Many cubicle structures could have served as foundations for 2-storey constructions, as at Basta and Baja 
(Gebel and Hermansen 1999). Interestingly, but entirely coincidentally, anyone familiar 
with later PPNB cellular architecture will probably feel at home amongst the pueblo 
constructions of the ancient and modern Southwest of the USA. Twelfth-century Pueblo 
Bonito, Chetro Ketl, and Aztec Ruin, and the modern multi-story apartment buildings in 
Taos Pueblo, come to mind especially.

19. On the ritual buildings and constructions discussed in these paragraphs, see Stordeur 
2000 (Jerf el Ahmar); Hauptmann 1999 (Gobekli Tepe and Nevali Cori); Rollefson 1998 
(Ain Ghazal); Verhoeven 1997 (Sabi Abyad); Schirmer 1990 (cayonii); Goring-Morris 
2000 and Keys 2003 (Kfar HaHoresh); Gebel and Hermansen 1999 (Ba'ja); Schmidt 2003 
and many articles in the journal Neo-Lithics (Gobekli Tepe). See also general discussions 
in Kuijt 2000b.

20. For instance, Aurenche and Calley 1988; Cauvin 1988, 2000; Aurenche 1989; Bar-Yosef 
and Belfer-Cohen 1989b, 1991; Gopher and Gophra 1994; Miller 1991; Garfinkel 1994; 
Banning 1998:215.

21. It is often extremely hard to know whether an episode of environmental degradation in 
the presence of a large human population was caused by the activity of that population 
alone, or whether independent adverse environmental changes (e.g., a drying climate) 
acted as a prime mover. Both can cause degradation, but a natural change could presumably only be established as the primary cause from multiple pollen cores, including some 
from regions where human activity is not in evidence. The Middle East does not have 
such a wonderful pollen record for the time period in question. Many scholars tend to 
blame humans for "catastrophes" of this type, particularly when they occur in the 
Holocene amongst societies at a high level of population density and social complexity.

Chapter 4

1. Simmons 1998, 1999. It is not absolutely clear that Neolithic farmers exterminated these 
animals; a different population of hunters could possibly have arrived a little before them.

2. Demoule and Perles 1993; Demoule 1993; Halstead 1996; van Andel and Runnels 1995; 
Runnels and Murray 2001.

3. Bailey et al. 2002 discuss the transition from tells in the southern Balkans to more shortlived settlements in the northern Balkans.

4. The debate is between Fox (1996: in favor of Neolithic population immigration, supported 
by Zilhao 2000, 2001) and Jackes et al. (1997a, 1997b: against Neolithic immigration, 
supported by Ribe et al. 1997). Whatever the answer, analyses of stable isotopes in 
human bone certainly indicate a major dietary change from Mesolithic into Neolithic in 
Portugal (Zilhao 2000:162).

5. Gronenborn (1999:143) also discusses evidence from pottery decoration that Neolithic 
traditions of both Danubian and Mediterranean origin met and mixed in northern France. 
See also Sherratt 1997a:fig. 13.1. The Hoguette pottery tradition of the Rhineland might 
indeed reflect Mesolithic adoption of pottery from a southern Cardial source, rather 
than from the LBK (Street et al. 2001).

6. This section on the LBK is compiled from many sources, useful ones being Keeley and 
Cahen 1989; Keeley 1992; Kooijmans 1993; Bogucki 1987, 1988, 1996a, 1996b; Bogucki 
and Grygiel 1993; Statible 1995; Sherratt 1997a; Gronenborn 1999; Kruk and Milisauskas 
1999; Bradley 2001; Collard and Shennan 2000; Shennan 2002:247-251.

7. Note that Raemakers (2003) favors a much more rapid switch from Mesolithic to Neolithic 
in the lower Rhine than most other authors, suggesting that the apparent long overlap 
might just be an epiphenomenon of site preservation factors. Otherwise, this section on 
Ertebelle and TRB is compiled from Arias 1999; Price 1987, 1996; Price and Gebauer 
1992; Rowley-Conwy 1984, 1995, 1999; Solberg 1989; Midgley 1992; Zvelevil 1996a, 
1996b; Street et al. 2001; Nowak 2001.

8. For instance, Midgley (1992), Bogucki (1996b), Price (1996), Thomas (1996), 
Nowak (2001) and Zvelebil (1996a, 1996b, 1998, 2000) all believe in some degree 
of Mesolithic input into the post-Ertebelle TRB culture, some more strongly than 
others.

9. Schild (1998) attributes many of the pottery finds to stratigraphic mixing, so some 
caution is required in accepting this concept of a Jomon-like non-agricultural "Neolithic" 
for the eastern Baltic region.

10. For instance, the Balbridie Neolithic timbered hall in Scotland, dated to 4000 BC 
(Fairweather and Ralston 1993), and some early Neolithic houses in Ireland (Grogan 
2002)). Other recent northwest European and British Neolithic evidence suggestive of 
sharp dietary and cultural change from Mesolithic into Neolithic is offered by RowleyConwy 2000; Kimball 2000; Schulting 2000; Dark and Gent 2001. Recent stable isotope 
studies on ancient bones also suggest a marked shift from riverine or coastal to "terrestrial" (i.e., plant-based) diets across the Mesolithic-Neolithic boundary in various regions 
of Europe (e.g., Bonsall et al. 1997 for the Danube Basin; Richards and Hedges 1999 for 
northern Europe and Iberia; Zilhao 2000 for Iberia; Schulting and Richards 2002 for 
Wales; Richards et al. 2003 for Denmark). This counteracts the view that the Mesolithic 
economy simply went on regardless into the Early Neolithic (but see Milner et al. 2004 
for cautions).

11. Note here that only in southern New Zealand, beyond the range of agriculture, did 
these people actually become permanent hunter-gatherers. The tropical Polynesians and 
North Island Maoris reverted to their ancestral agricultural economy as the natural 
resources became scarcer due to overexploitation.

12. General accounts of Mehrgarh can be found in Lechevallier and Quivron 1979; Jarrige 
and Meadow 1980, 1992; Jarrige 1993; Costantini 1981; Meadow 1989, 1993, 1998.

13. Claims for a very early appearance of agriculture in Sri Lanka exist but are unsupported 
by firm archaeological evidence (Deraniyagala 2001).

14. On African millets and legumes in South Asia see Possehl 1986; Kajale 1991; Reddy 1997; 
Weber 1991, 1998, 1999; Blench 2003. But see Rowley-Conwy et al. 1997 and Fuller 2001 
for doubts concerning some sites, also Wigboldus 1996 who believes that all the African 
millets in India are of medieval date or later, a view not well supported by an increasing 
number of archaeological finds.

15. References on Pre-Harappan archaeology are voluminous, but pertinent ones for this 
section include R.P. Singh 1990; Kajale 1991 (both general paleobotanical reviews); 
Dhavalikhar and Possehl 1992 (Gujarat); Shudai 1996-97; Sonawane 2000 (Gujarat): 
Chakrabarti 1999; Misra 2001; Possehl 2002.

16. See IAR 1981-82: 19-20 (Gufkral); Buth and Kaw 1985 (Burzahom); Dikshit 2000.

17. By the end of the third millennium BC the African millets had reached the eastern fringes 
of the Harappan region, as had rice (Fujiwara 1993). Various crop combinations involving millets and rice are reported from sites of the early second millennium BC in Gujarat, 
such as Rojdi (Weber 1991, 1993, 1999, 1998) and Rangpur (Rao 1962-63). See also 
Possehl 1986; Fuller 2002, 2003.

18. Sources on these cultures are many, but see Chakrabarti 1999; Clason 1977; Dhavalikar 
1988, 1994, 1997; Dhavalikar et al. 1988; Kajale 1996a; Misra 1997; Misra et al. 1995, 
Shinde 1991, 1994, 2000; Thomas 2000.

19. See V. D. Misra 2002 for cord-marking on Ochre Coloured pottery. Cord-marked pottery was made with a paddle and anvil, the paddle (normally a wooden beater) being 
wrapped with some form of cordage or basketry and used to beat the outer surface of 
the pot prior to firing. It is very common in Chinese and Mainland Southeast Asian 
Neolithic contexts, as well as in the Japanese Jomon.

20. Chirand lacks cord-marked pottery but otherwise has pottery similar to that from Neolithic 
Koldihwa; Misra 1977:116. Narhan 1, dated from about 1300 BC (Singh 1994), has rice, 
hexaploid wheats, pearl millet, barley, zebu cattle, BRW and cord-marked pottery, and 
small items of copper.

21. References for these sites include Liversage 1992; Dhavalikar 1997; R. P. Singh 1990; 
A. K. Singh 1998; P. Singh 1994, 1998; Sathe and Badam 1996.

22. Liversage 1992; Allchin and Allchin 1982 are in favor of continuity; Lal 1984 against.

Chapter 5

1. On sub-Saharan domestication records for specific crops, see MacDonald 1998; RowleyConwy et al. 1997; Wetterstrom 1998; D'Andrea and Casey 2002; and papers in van der 
Veen 1999.

2. On the various occurrences of early pottery in northern Africa see Mohammad-Ali 1987; 
Roset 1987; Krzyzaniak 1991; Muzzolini 1993; Haaland 1993, 1999; Close 1995, 1996; 
Barich 1997; Wasylikowa et al. 1997; Wetterstrom 1998; Hassan 1998; Midant-Reynes 
2000; Cremaschi and di Lernia 2001; Wendorf et al. 2001.

3. David Phillipson (pers. comm.) agrees that there was some dispersal of early farming 
communities in West Africa along or close to the Atlantic coast southward to northern 
Angola, but feels that there is little evidence in support of a Western Bantu spread southeastward across the continent.

Chapter 6

1. The possibility that arboriculture and field agriculture were present in Jomon Japan must 
not be overlooked - rice was present in some regions of Japan from Middle Jomon times 
onward, and millets were fairly universal. For Jomon agricultural activity in general see 
Imamura 1996; Crawford and Chen 1998; D'Andrea 1999; and several papers in Yasuda 
2002.

2. MacNeish and Libby 1995; MacNeish et al. 1998; MacNeish 1999; Zhao 1998; Pringle 
1998; Zhang 1999; Chen 1999. The dates offered for cultural developments for Xianrendong 
and Diaotonghuan vary somewhat according to author.

3. See, for instance, the variety of opinions given in the various papers in Antiquity 72, 1998, 
Special Section on Rice Domestication, and in Yasuda 2002. Many translations of Chinese 
articles on rice origins are available in the Ancient Chinese Rice Archaeological Project 
web site www.carleton.ca/-bgordon/Rice/. The DNA evidence for a separate origin of 
indica and japonica, however, does appear to be very strong (Bautista et al. 2001).

4. And, for what it is worth, very similar to joinery in prehistoric New Zealand! Hemudu 
carpentry, adze handles, and wooden tops closely resemble those of late prehistoric Maoris 
(e.g., Bellwood 1978b for the Lake Mangakaware excavations). This does not mean that 
Maori ancestry should be traced directly to Hemudu, but it does mean that many aspects 
of Austronesian material culture and technology in the Pacific can be traced back to 
coastal Neolithic China.

5. Such perforations were perhaps made in the first instance to allow hot gases to escape from 
inside the pedestal during firing. Pottery of this shape occurs from Neolithic China right 
through island Southeast Asia into the Lapita cultural complex in western Melanesia.

Chapter 7

1. Recent surveys include Bellwood 1992, 1996a, 1996b, 1997a, 1998a, 1998b, 2000a, 2000b, 
2001f, Bellwood and Hiscock in press. See also Higham 1996a, 1996b, 2002, 2004; Higham 
and Thosarat 1998a; Spriggs 1989, 1999, 2003; and many chapters in Glover and Bellwood 
eds. 2004. Other, more Pacific-focused surveys include Kirch 1997, 2000; Spriggs 1997a; 
Bellwood 2001e.

2. Items such as spindle whorls and bovid bones do not generally occur in the Neolithic of 
Island Southeast Asia, at least not south of northern Luzon in the Philippines. This 
statement merely generalizes about a trend.

3. Madagascar was settled in the mid-first millennium AD by Indonesian agriculturalists, 
probably in the main from southern Borneo, with linguistic influences from Malay and 
Javanese (Adelaar 1996; Verin and Wright 2000). At present there is no clear evidence for 
any older population on the island (but see MacPhee and Burney 1991). This chapter 
does not deal further with Madagascar, which geographically is, of course, part of Africa. 
But this island might have played a role in the spread of Southeast Asian crops such as 
bananas, taro, and the greater yam into tropical Africa.

4. Recent reports which deal specifically with these sites include Higham and Bannanurag 
1990 and onward; Higham and Thosarat 1994; Higham and Thosarat 1998b; White 1982, 
1997; Pigott and Natapintu 1996-97.

5. In this chapter I use pinyin spellings for Taiwan place names.

6. On these assemblages see Chang 1995; Bellwood 1997b, 2000b; Yang 1995; Tsang 1992, 
1995. Tsang Cheng-hwa of the National Museum of Prehistory in Taiwan (2004) also 
sees close relationships between early Taiwan pottery and that of the Guangdong coastal 
Neolithic sites. TianlongJiao of the Bishop Museum in Honolulu is currently preparing 
new data on coastal Fujian sites for publication.

7. This information comes from current research by Hung Hsiao-chun (ANU, Canberra), 
Yoshi lizuka (Academia Sinica, Taipei), Eusebio Dizon (National Museum, Manila) and 
the author. The Batanes Islands have produced a 3,500-year sequence with very close 
ties to Taiwan maintained for at least the first 2,000 years of this time span. For preliminary results see Bellwood et al. 2003.

8. In Bellwood 1997a:237-238) I raised the possibility of a Neolithic movement to Borneo 
from the Malay Peninsula. It was made in the light of linguistic parallels between Aslian 
and Sarawak Austronesian languages suggested by Adelaar (1995), but discussions with 
Sander Adelaar since then have convinced me that the linguistic explanation is somewhat different. The details are not essential for present purposes.

9. Hunter-gatherers would not have found sufficient food for long-term survival on small 
and isolated Oceanic islands. Although small islands were often colonized in Indonesia 
by as much as 35,000 years ago, they were always close to larger ones such that the 
population could be peripatetic when necessary (Bellwood et al. 1998). In terms of boat 
technology, hunter-gatherer populations were able to reach the islands of Indonesia, 
New Guinea, and Australia before 35,000 years ago, but in order to do this they 
normally only had to cross narrow sea gaps with land visible on the other side. They 
probably paddled bamboo rafts in monsoon-determined periods of quiet ocean surface. 
Maximum distances up to 200 kilometers, from New Guinea to the Admiralty Islands or 
from mainland Asia/Japan to Okinawa, were also crossed, but rarely. The more recent 
Austronesian agriculturalist populations were able to cross distances of 2000 kilometers 
or more, from 1500 BC onward (e.g., Philippines to Guam), using sailing canoes with 
outriggers (Anderson 2000).

10. On the Kuk research and its implications, see Golson 1977; Golson and Gardner 1990; 
Swadling and Hope 1992; Bayliss-Smith and Golson 1992; Haberle and Chepstow-Lusty 
2000; Denham et al. 2003; Denham 2003; Haberle 2003.

Chapter 8

1. For suggestions of multiple origin see Pickersgill 1989; Hastorf 1999; Jones and Brown 
2000. Bonavia and Grobman 1989 suggest it for maize, clearly very likely if maize spread 
initially as a source of sugar and was later domesticated for its cob (Smalley and Blake 
2003).

2. Note also that Mangelsdorf et al. 1964 regarded early wild maize as an independent 
species distinct from teosinte.

3. For current debate see Tykot and Staller 2002; Staller and Thompson 2002. Pearsall 2002 
still favors older dates, suggesting that maize was common at Valdivia in Ecuador by 3500 
Bc, according to a presence of maize phytoliths in the deposits. Previous discussions of 
maize dating in South America include Bird 1990; Wilson 1985; Hastorf and Johannessen 
1994; Piperno 1998; Hastorf 1999; Lynch 1999. Large Pre-ceramic sites older than 2000 Be 
without maize in northern Peru include La Galgada (Grieder et al. 1988), Huaynuna (Pozorski and Pozorski 1990), Aspero (Feldman 1985) and El Paraiso (Quilter et al. 1991). 
There is still much uncertainty.

4. Hastorf (1999:45) claims domesticated common beans (Phaseolis vulgaris) from about 8000 BC 
in Peru, but Smith (2001:1325) indicates AMS dates for this species in Mexico back to only 
300 Bc.

5. For an aerial photograph of Cerro Juanaquena, see LeBlanc 2003.

6. References on the domestication history of the crops of the Eastern Woodlands are very 
numerous. Some of the most thorough include Ford 1985 (many papers); Keegan 1987 (many 
papers); Adair 1988; Jennings 1989; Fritz 1990; Smith 1992a, 1992b, 1995; Scarry 1993 (many 
papers); Green 1994 (many papers); Johannessen and Hastorf 1994 (many papers); Hart 1999.

Chapter 9

1. After his return from Cook's Second Voyage, discussing the languages that today are 
termed Austronesian (Thomas et al. 1996:190).

2. For instance, according to Hines (1998:284): "I can see no reason to resist the notion that 
in the vast periods of prehistory, and over the vast geographical ranges of the world's 
major language phyla, dispersal, isolation (in my view the critical factor) and divergence 
were dominant trends." See also Ross 1997 for an excellent discussion of this point. 
Coleman 1988, Nichols 1997a, Dolgopolsky 1993, and Hayward 2000 all reject convergence 
between unrelated languages as a source of language families, and reject in particular the 
theory of Trubetzkoy (1939) that Indo-European has no homeland at all, and is purely a 
result of convergence.

3. For an excellent example of the use of a reconstructed proto-language together with the 
archaeological record, in this case to build up a record of the culture and lifestyle of the 
Proto-Polynesians, see Patrick Kirch and Roger Green 2001. But Soeren Wichmann (2003) 
notes, following the recent successful decipherment of many Mayan inscriptions, that 
reconstructed proto-languages can often be quite imperfect in detail.

4. Innovation-defined (tree-like) subgroups and innovation-linked (rake-like) subgroups are 
discussed in more technical detail by Andrew Pawley and Malcolm Ross 1993, 1995; Ross 
1997. These issues are also discussed by Nichols (1997a), who associates rake-like subgroup 
relationships with what she terms "spread zones." Nichols (1998b:136) also suggests that all 
the major branches of Indo-European had already diverged within 1,000 years of the existence of Proto-Indo-European, thus forming a rake-like distribution owing to rapid dispersal.

5. Ross (1994) gives a good example of interference through shift in New Ireland, where the 
Kuot people, former speakers of a Papuan language, have adopted an Austronesian language and in the process have modified the latter with an input of Papuan phonology.

6. This might not have been true of pre-contact New Caledonia, but there is not space here 
to go further into this matter.

Chapter 10

1. The PIE vocabulary is discussed in many sources. See Watkins 1985; Mallory 1996; 
Mallory and Adams 1997; Anthony 1995; Lehmann 1993; Gamkrelidze and Ivanov 1995. 
Comrie 2003 suggests that a reconstruction for "plough" demands a post-Neolithic date for PIE, but use of the and surely goes back to the beginnings of agriculture and animal 
domestication in Europe, and possibly southwestern Asia too.

2. In 1988, American biological anthropologist Grover Krantz (1988) published, seemingly 
quite independently of Colin Renfrew, a similar hypothesis of Neolithic spread out of 
Anatolia for the early IE languages. Krantz set out a number of rather compelling principles that still carry much conviction today - for instance, populations and languages do 
not normally spread far unless there is a compelling reason, and some technological or 
numerical superiority would normally be required on the part of those doing the moving into previously inhabited regions. Krantz' precise reconstructions for European, and 
Indo-European, prehistory need not be detailed here - suffice it to say that he regarded 
Neolithic Europe as an arena for both IE and Afro-Asiatic expansion, noting that the 
kurgan (Pontic steppes) hypothesis was untenable.

3. Some linguists dispute the existence of AA, for instance Campbell 1999, who doubts the 
membership of Omotic and Chadic.

4. According to Kumar (1988), the Rigvedic texts have many references to agriculture. 
A term for barley also reconstructs to proto-Indo-Aryan according to Masica (1979), 
although many crop words were borrowed, as we would expect from an understanding 
of the archaeological prehistory of India.

5. Renfrew 1989, 1991, 1992a, 1992b; Bellwood 1989; and see also similar ideas in Sherratt 
and Sherratt 1988, who were perhaps the first to propose such a radial model. A number 
of archaeologists were clearly coming independently to such conclusions in the late 
1980s. In more recent papers (e.g., 2001b), Renfrew has become more cautious about the 
reality of macrofamilies.

6. Basic references on Nostratic (in English) include Kaiser and Shevoroshkin 1988; 
Shevoroshkin and Manaster Ramer 1991; Shevoroshkin 1992; Bombard and Kerns 1994; 
Bomhard 1996; Dolgopolsky 1998; and see a wide range of discussion from many viewpoints in Renfrew and Nettle 1999. Nostratic is based on a number of lexical cognates, 
especially pronouns. Claims for 600 or more widespread cognates now exist in the 
literature (Michalove et al. 1998).

7. Frequent suggestions are for Austronesian-Austroasiatic relationships (e.g., Reid 1988, 
1996); Austronesian-Tai relationships (e.g., Benedict 1975), and also Austronesian-Sino- 
Tibetan relationships (Sagart 1994, 2002, 2003). See Egerod 1991; Blust 1996 and Sagart 
et al. in press for current debate.

8. Sagart 1994, 2002; see Chang 1986:162 for Dawenkou tooth extraction.

9. Some of the great variation in opinion can be gauged by examining Unger 1990; Bombard 
1990; Miller 1991; Janhunen 1996.

10. These dates are merely averages of estimates by several linguists. For data see Migliazza 
1982; Kaufman 1990a; and other sources listed in Bellwood 2000c:129-130.

11. The Yanomama speak a language related to Panoan.

12. See discussion in American Anthropologist 82:850-857 (1980), 83:905-911 (1981) and 85:362- 
372 (1983).

13. But see also the arguments against a Nahuatl affiliation for Teotihuacan given by Kaufman 
2001; Beekman and Christensen 2003.

14. Jane Hill has suggested to me (pers. comm.) that the Fremont population could have 
been multi-linguistic, involving possibly some Tanoan speakers as well.

15. Kelly 1997:22 suggests that summer rainfall from the southwest might have been greater 
then than now. See also Madsen and Simms 1998.

16. Figure 3.4 in Snow 1996 suggests that Canada north of the Great Lakes and the St 
Lawrence was relatively free of human population during the Archaic.

17. Rankin does not include Catawba as a Siouan language, although Foster includes it 
within a Siouan-Catawba grouping.

Chapter 11

1. As argued, for instance, by Bateman et al. (1990). In agreement with Cavalli-Sforza and 
colleagues, Barbujani and Sokal (1990) claim that language affiliations of European populations have played a major role in maintaining genetic differences, whereas adaptations 
to different environments do not appear to have been significant in this regard.

2. Mitochondrial DNA is transmitted through females, and produces enzymes that power 
cells and convert food into energy. The Y-chromosome is transmitted through males and 
is the one that determines biological maleness in the offspring. The most important 
observation about these genetic systems is that they do not recombine at meiosis in each 
generation, and so they pass through time as true lineages that only change through 
occasional mutations. Such mutations are amenable to molecular clock calculations of 
their ages if there are calibration scales available, but dating of this type can be highly 
problematic.

3. See also Kivisild et al. 2002 for similar observations that mtDNA lineages differentiate 
Northeast from Southeast Asian populations, but also underlining the significance of 
Yayoi immigration into Japan from Korea. On the other hand, Tajima et al. (2002) suggest 
a close grouping of Han Chinese with many Southeast Asian populations. The debate is 
too new for much consensus to have emerged.

4. The week before final proof reading I attended a conference on Human Migrations in 
Continental East Asia and Taiwan, held in the University of Geneva (June 2004). Jean 
Trejaut from the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei here offered a new coalescence age 
of only 6,900 years for the Polynesian motif, together with an age for the ancestral form 
of only 10,000 years in Taiwan or China. These ages are calibrated against ages for the 
human-chimp lineage split, and represent more than a halving of the Oppenheimer and 
Richards estimate. I do not know which age is correct for the mutation of the Polynesian 
motif, but the true answer, if it can ever be found, will no doubt be interesting.
