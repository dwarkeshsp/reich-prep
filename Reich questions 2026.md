# David Reich Interview Questions — 2026

## I. The Akbari Paper — What It Found and How

**1. The new preprint.** Your lab has a new preprint using 8,433 ancient genomes to scan for selection over the last 14,000 years. Walk me through what you found.

**2. The 279 loci.** You had 8,210 loci that were significant after controlling for population structure via the GRM, but simulations showed a 44% false discovery rate. You then used GWAS enrichment to whittle that down to 279. Is the right way to understand this that roughly 56% of 8,210 — so ~4,600 loci — were genuinely under selection, and the 279 are just the ones you're most confident about? How many loci do you think have actually been under selection?

**3. Why don't previous findings replicate?** Mathieson et al. 2015: 10/11 replicate. Le et al.: 9/22. Kerner et al.: 14/123. Field et al. sub-threshold: 1/34. You suggest prior studies were producing false positives at 40-60% rates. But couldn't it be that different methods are sensitive to different kinds of selection, and yours is missing things they caught?

**4. Background selection.** How do you deal with the concern that background selection inflates both your selection statistics *and* GWAS associations — meaning their correlation could reflect shared confounding rather than genuine validation?

## II. Why These Traits and Not Others?

**5. The lactase timing puzzle.** Mathieson & Terhorst 2022 found selection on lactase persistence was strongest during the Bronze Age (4,500-3,000 years ago) at s ≈ 0.08, then weakened to ~0.02. But farming started thousands of years earlier in Britain, and dairy consumption in Europe goes back to ~6000 BC. Why did selection peak so late, and why did it then decline?

**6. Arbitrary winners and losers.** Some of the most differentiated loci between populations are things like eye color, which has no obvious fitness consequence. Meanwhile, APOE (Alzheimer's/longevity), FTO (largest effect on obesity), IL23R (largest protective effect for autoimmune disease), and variants shifting menopause by 5-10 years show zero evidence of selection. Why is evolution picking eye color over obesity resistance?

**7. Immunity but not cognition.** Your paper found immune/metabolic traits enriched 3-6x among loci under selection, but behavioral and cognitive traits show zero enrichment. Is this a real biological finding, or is it that GWAS for cognitive traits are too noisy to detect selection even if it happened? And if it's real — if the brain wasn't under much selection pressure during the agricultural revolution — what does that imply?

**8. But wait — the polygenic cognitive signal.** At the aggregate level, you *do* find polygenic selection favoring alleles associated with intelligence, income, and schooling. But these same alleles overlap heavily with anti-diabetes variants. How do you distinguish selection *on* cognition from selection on metabolism where cognitive associations are a pleiotropic side effect?

## III. Where Are the Sweeps?

**9. No fixed differences anywhere.** Coop et al. 2009 found almost all allele frequency differences between 50+ global populations are explained by drift. Mallick et al. 2016 found zero species-wide sweeps in the past 50,000 years. Your paper says the genome is "seething" with selection. How do you reconcile these?

**10. The slave trade paradox.** Your own lab found no detectable selection in African Americans over ~12 generations of extreme environmental pressure. If that didn't leave a genetic trace, what kind of pressure *is* strong enough to drive the selection you're detecting in ancient Eurasia?

**11. Masked sweeps.** Souilmi et al. 2022 found 57 hard sweeps in ancient Eurasian genomes, but only 2 were detectable in modern populations — the rest erased by admixture. How much selection do you think has been permanently masked by gene flow?

**12. Subtle selection or subtle per-allele effects?** It seems like there are two explanations for the gap between "lots of selection in ancient DNA" and "no fixed differences between modern populations." Either selection is genuinely weak and ephemeral, or it's strong but so polygenic that each variant shifts by a tiny amount. Which do you think is closer to the truth?

## IV. Polygenic Selection and How Evolution Works

**13. How does polygenic selection work mechanistically?** If height is influenced by 100,000 variants and selection pushes populations taller, each allele shifts by 1/100,000th of the fitness effect — undetectable individually. But they can't all be neutral or evolution wouldn't work. Is that really how the genome operates — huge numbers of alleles under extremely weak selection simultaneously?

**14. Does gene flow count as selection?** Your work has shown how much allele frequency change comes from migration and population replacement rather than classical selection. But if some gene is relevant to why one population outcompetes another, isn't that selection at a different level? Why treat admixture as a purely neutral process?

**15. Effective population size of ~10,000.** What are the consequences of humanity's effective population size being so small? Does it mean drift is just too powerful for most selection to leave a trace?

## V. Convergent Selection Across Populations

**16. The Colbran result.** Colbran et al. 2025 found that 215 loci under selection in Europe are also enriched for selection in East Asia, South Asia, and the Americas — but not Africa. Either there's convergent selection on the same variants across different environments, or this selection happened before the non-African populations split and the models are misattributing old selection to recent periods. Which interpretation do you favor?

## VI. What Selection Tells Us About Human History

**17. When was selection strongest?** Mathieson & Terhorst found selection peaking in the Bronze Age. Your paper shows blood/immune selection intensifying from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age. Does this support the view that early farming was actually fine, and the health costs came later with population density and crowding?

**18. Did agriculture change us genetically?** Cox et al. 2025 found Neolithic people were only modestly shorter than hunter-gatherers, and most of the difference was genetic ancestry, not environmental. Does this challenge the "farming made people unhealthy" narrative?

**19. Behavioral modernity.** Mallick et al. 2016 found no loci with fixed differences between archaic and modern humans. Does this mean nothing genetically special happened 50,000 years ago — that the "human revolution" was cultural all the way?

**20. The big picture.** Setting aside methodology — what are you now confident saying about the last 10,000-50,000 years of human evolution that we didn't know before ancient DNA?
